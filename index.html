        <h3>Who's SGR;-;?</h3>
        <div class="center-p"><p class="cneter-p">Hello, I am a SGR;-;. I am JapaneseðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ and a student. I can speak English reasonably well, I enjoy writing code. I'll write it below as a list in a way that my personal information doesn't come out.
            I was born in Kyushu, Japan and grew up in Tokyo, Japan.
            Since I was a little girl, I have been watching foreign videos from English-speaking countries. (YouTube, Facebook, etc.)
            I also learned MEME, etc. around this time.
            
            I met code when I was around elementary school age.
            Learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C#, C++, Swift, Bat, JSON, etc. halfway through my childhood.
            In his senior year, he began serious study of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Two months later, he learns Python, JSON, and C as much as he can.
            
            Now, he is creating and developing websites, apps, Discord bots, and AI.
            
            Here's what it looks like. I feel like I can code because I saw the English-speaking world when I was little.
            I'm kind of scared that I feel like my life is about to be mostly taken up by code. I am a student, but I write code. So I don't go out much.
            That's about it...
            
            In summary, I am a student who speaks English reasonably well and can code.
            However, I can be a pain in the ass, so please don't rely on me too much.</p></div>
